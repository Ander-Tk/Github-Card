# Github Card  

This is my remixed solution for [Profile card component](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/profile-card-component-cfArpWshJ). 

In order to put a little more flavor into this challenge a few changes have been made.
* The page design has been changed to be a bit more similar to github and its color scheme.
* Github API was used to request and create a custom user card.
